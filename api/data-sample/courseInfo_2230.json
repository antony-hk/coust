We are seeing a war all but in name that is broadcasted on 24\/7 news networks. All these incidents affect not just nearby countries but have global impact affecting all countries to a lesser or greater extent. These impacts are not just rocking global geopolitics, they are also tumbling our 21st century inter-connected and inter-reliant economies. One of the most gyrating industries is civil aviation, which at one point collapsed to just 05% of its former self. One lesson learned in the aviation industry is the need for all industry stakeholders to build up operational resilience. Strengthened operational resilience enables all stakeholders to meet risks and threats that can come from anywhere around the globe.

Synthetic biology brings together biology, biotechnology, computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics to create useful genetic tools and platforms. It is also a strategy to help us understand basic biological regulatory mechanisms and complex genetic networks: by designing and building artificial ones, we learn how they work in nature (understanding by building). In this course, you will study the theoretical underpinnings of cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and learn how the development of disruptive technologies, combined with engineering principles, led to the emergence of this new scientific field. You will also learn how basic theory and knowledge of biology can guide the rational design of artificial biological circuits in living cells to accomplish well-defined goals. The goal of the course is to help you acquire essential techniques in synthetic biology, such as designing and constructing genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems, and develop new perspectives and skills that may help you in the future meet the demands of the biotech industry and academia.","vector":"[3-0-0:3]","attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"1065","datetime":["We 03:00PM - 05:50PM"],"room":"G002, CYT Bldg (30)","instructor":["LAI, Yong"],"quota":{"all":"30","details":[]},"enrol":"8","avail":"22","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"3"},"BIEN6990":{"code":"BIEN6990","name":"MPhil Thesis Research","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":"BIEN 699","description":"Master's thesis research supervised by a faculty member.

At various sections of the course, we will invite seasoned speaker to share with you their views and experiences on relevant topics.","vector":"[2-0-0:2]","attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"4411","datetime":["07-FEB-2023 - 04-APR-2023","Tu 09:00AM - 11:50AM"],"room":"Rm 2406, Lift 17-18 (76)","instructor":["LAU, Jack"],"quota":{"all":"75","details":["Quota\/Enrol\/Avail","AESF: 1\/1\/0","EESM: 74\/39\/35"]},"enrol":"45","avail":"30","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"2"},"EESM6900":{"code":"EESM6900","name":"Independent Study","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":"EESM 690","description":"Selected topics in electronic and computer engineering studied under the supervision of a faculty member.","vector":"[3 credits]","attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"T1","classnum":"4405","datetime":["TBA"],"room":"TBA","instructor":[],"quota":{"all":"15","details":[]},"enrol":"10","avail":"5","wait":"0","remarks":["Instructor Consent Required"]}],"credit":"3"},"EESM6980H":{"code":"EESM6980H","name":"MSc Project","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":null,"description":"Independent project carried out under the supervision of a faculty member.

However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.","vector":null,"attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"2250","datetime":["MoWe 09:00AM - 10:20AM"],"room":"Rm 2504, Lift 25-26 (84)","instructor":["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"],"quota":{"all":"15","details":[]},"enrol":"14","avail":"1","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"3"},"ELEC3200":{"code":"ELEC3200","name":"System Modeling, Analysis and Control","prerequisite":"(ELEC 2100 OR ELEC 2100H) AND [MATH 2350 OR (MATH 2111 AND MATH 2351)]","exclusion":"CENG 3110, MECH 3610","prevcode":null,"description":"This course introduces basic concepts, tools and techniques for modeling, analysis, and control of dynamical systems.

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.","vector":null,"attributes":null,"attributes_popup":null,"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"2724","datetime":["MoWe 09:00AM - 10:20AM"],"room":"Rm 2504, Lift 25-26 (84)","instructor":["PEREZ PALOMAR, Daniel"],"quota":{"all":"25","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"5","wait":"0","remarks":""}],"credit":"3"},"IEDA3230":{"code":"IEDA3230","name":"Engineering Economics and Accounting","prerequisite":null,"exclusion":null,"prevcode":"IELM 3230","description":"Application of microeconomics to engineering and managerial decision making.

Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users.

We shall look at major issues that have drawn the two states together, and those that continue to divide the two powers.

This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of the course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn to real-world data.
