This historical background is important to view the socio-economic characteristics of the pre-1949 Chinese society and their relevance to modern economic growth. This course also exposes the students to the basic concepts and analytic tools in political economy such as market economy, the state, conflict of interests, correlation and causality, and selection bias.
