Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.","vector":null,"attributes":["Common Core (H) for 36-credit program","Common Core (SSC-H) for 36-credit program","[BLD] Blended learning"],"attributes_popup":[["[4Y]","Students admitted before 2022"],["[DELI]","Mode of Delivery"]],"matching":null,"sections":[{"section":"L1","classnum":"2518","datetime":["Mo 12:00PM - 01:50PM"],"room":"Lecture Theater A (401)","instructor":["PAN, Ping","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"400","details":[]},"enrol":"398","avail":"2","wait":"0","remarks":["> The class is delivered in a blended learning mode"]},{"section":"T01","classnum":"2520","datetime":["Th 11:00AM - 12:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","SHEN, Chi"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T02","classnum":"2522","datetime":["Th 11:00AM - 12:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","SHEN, Chi"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T03","classnum":"2523","datetime":["Mo 09:30AM - 11:20AM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["LAM, Chak Yan Jessie Teresa","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T04","classnum":"2524","datetime":["Mo 09:30AM - 11:20AM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["LAM, Chak Yan Jessie Teresa","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T05","classnum":"2525","datetime":["We 05:00PM - 06:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","STAMPER, Suzan"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T06","classnum":"2526","datetime":["We 05:00PM - 06:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","STAMPER, Suzan"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"19","avail":"1","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T07","classnum":"2527","datetime":["Th 05:00PM - 06:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","WONG, Lee Long Shaun"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T08","classnum":"2528","datetime":["Th 05:00PM - 06:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","WONG, Lee Long Shaun"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T09","classnum":"2529","datetime":["Tu 11:30AM - 01:20PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","WONG, Nick"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T10","classnum":"2530","datetime":["Tu 11:30AM - 01:20PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["PUN, Wing Man Winnie","WONG, Nick"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T11","classnum":"2531","datetime":["We 11:00AM - 12:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["LEE, William W L","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T12","classnum":"2532","datetime":["We 11:00AM - 12:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["LEE, William W L","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T13","classnum":"2533","datetime":["Fr 04:00PM - 05:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["LEE, William W L","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T14","classnum":"2534","datetime":["Fr 04:00PM - 05:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["LEE, William W L","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T15","classnum":"2535","datetime":["Tu 02:00PM - 03:50PM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["FREEMAN, Danyal Jonathan","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":""},{"section":"T16","classnum":"2536","datetime":["Tu 02:00PM - 03:50PM"],"room":"TBA","instructor":["FREEMAN, Danyal Jonathan","PUN, Wing Man Winnie"],"quota":{"all":"20","details":[]},"enrol":"20","avail":"0","wait":"0","remarks":["> Venue : Room 3494"]},{"section":"T17","classnum":"2537","datetime":["We 09:00AM - 10:50AM"],"room":"Rm 3494, Lift 25-26 (20)","instructor":["MA, Martin, T.

We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end, in a group of 2-3 students.

This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course.
